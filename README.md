## Description

A simple todo application to maintain a list of todo's using the Laravel Framework.

This is my first project using PHP and Laravel and I look forward to updating this applicaiton with additional features upon gaining a better understanding of the fundamentals and basics.

Technologies used: PHP, Laravel, Eloquent ORM, Bootstrap 4, CSS3, HTML5, and MySQL.

Successes: 
* Built a fully functioning Todo Application using PHP and Laravel. 
* Gained fundamental knowledge on new technologies including: PHP, Laravel, SCSS, Eloquent, Composer, and Valet. 

Challenges: 
* Understanding how to recieve data regarding `completed_at` field. 
* Losing focus and trying to learn all the ins/outs of PHP and Laravel in lieu of getting the application dressed with full features. 
* Cleaning up my route conventions (Moving foward this will be the easiest to address).
* Aiming for perfection when I needed to be working towards a MVP.
